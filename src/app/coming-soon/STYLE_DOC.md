# Interactive Ball Trail Animation Style Guide

## Style Overview
Create a modern, interactive page with a dynamic ball trail animation that follows cursor/touch movements. The page should feature a dark gradient background with colorful, glowing particles that respond to user movement, creating an engaging and playful experience while maintaining content readability and interaction.

## Key Visual Elements
- Dark gradient background (black to dark gray)
- Collection of colorful, glowing particles that follow cursor movement
- Smooth animations with trailing effect
- Gradient text with subtle animations
- Bold, minimal content centered on page
- Modern gradient buttons with hover effects

## Technical Implementation

### Animation Core
- Use React useEffect and useRef to create and manage particle animations
- Create 25-40 particle elements with varying:
  - Colors from a curated palette
  - Sizes (10-25px range)
  - Animation speeds
  - Pulsing effects with randomized phases
- Apply subtle blur and glow effects to particles
- Implement a physics-based following behavior with:
  - Position-based trailing effect (slower movement for trailing particles)
  - Distance-based scaling
  - Opacity variation based on position in the trail

### Interactive Elements
- Ensure all clickable elements have:
  - Higher z-index than animation particles
  - Proper pointer events and touch handling
  - Visual feedback on hover/interaction
  - Enhanced visibility against the animation

### Content Styling
- Use gradient text effects for headings
- Implement smooth entrance animations using CSS transitions
- Center content with proper spacing and hierarchy
- Apply subtle shadows for text legibility against dynamic background
- Use minimal, focused content that doesn't compete with the animation

### Mobile Optimization
- Apply touch event handling that preserves interactive element functionality
- Implement logic to prevent default behavior only on non-interactive areas
- Ensure performance remains smooth on mobile devices
- Adjust particle count based on device performance

## Code Structure
1. Start with state and refs setup
2. Initialize animation elements with randomized properties
3. Implement event handlers with interactive element detection
4. Create animation loop with physics-based movement
5. Apply visual styling with CSS for both animation and content elements
6. Add entrance animations for content
7. Implement proper cleanup on unmount

## Example Implementation Guidance
When implementing a new page with this style:
1. Start with the dark gradient background
2. Add the ball trail animation system
3. Center your main content with proper z-indexing
4. Apply entrance animations to content elements
5. Ensure buttons and interactive elements have proper event handling
6. Test thoroughly on both desktop and mobile
