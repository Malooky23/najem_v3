# Orders Page Performance Optimization

This document outlines the performance optimization strategy for the orders page, which was refactored to follow the more efficient TX (Stock Movements) page pattern.

## Key Performance Issues Identified

1. **Inefficient Database Queries**
   - Separate queries for data and count
   - Complex nested JSON aggregation without proper indexing
   - Multiple data transformations

2. **Component Rendering Inefficiencies**
   - Excessive re-renders due to deeply nested component hierarchy
   - Circular dependencies in providers
   - Missing memoization on critical components

3. **State Management Problems**
   - Direct DOM manipulation for scroll position
   - Redundant state updates
   - Poor separation between UI and data state

4. **React Query Implementation**
   - Missing staleTime configuration
   - Lack of prefetching for pagination
   - Inefficient cache invalidation

## Implementation Improvements

### 1. Zustand Store Optimization
- Added optimized setter methods with previous state checking
- Implemented derived state getters (`getFilters`, `getSort`)
- Simplified state structure with single source of truth
- Added efficient URL synchronization

### 2. Database Query Optimization
- Added single SQL query with window function (`COUNT(*) OVER()`) for pagination
- Implemented helper functions for filters, sorting, and pagination
- Optimized data retrieval by selecting only needed fields
- Improved data transformation with better typing

### 3. Component Architecture
- Flattened component hierarchy
- Added memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented proper component boundaries
- Created consistent loading states

### 4. React Query Implementation
- Added appropriate staleTime configuration (24h for non-filtered data)
- Implemented keepPreviousData for UI stability
- Added prefetching for next page data
- Optimized query invalidation

## Performance Results

The refactored orders page now loads data significantly faster and provides a smoother user experience by:

1. Reducing database load with optimized queries
2. Minimizing UI re-renders with proper memoization
3. Improving data transfer with selective field retrieval
4. Enhancing perceived performance with prefetching

## Future Optimizations

1. Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
2. Implement virtualization for large data sets
3. Optimize images and assets
4. Add service worker for offline capability
5. Implement background data syncing for better network resilience
