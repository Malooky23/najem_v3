# Order Components Refactoring Changes

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring changes made to the order details components to improve performance and remove the dependency on the context API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Props Instead of Context

All components that previously relied on the `OrderDetailContext` have been refactored to use direct props:

- **OrderHeader**: Now accepts `orderNumber`, `status`, and `createdAt` props directly
- **OrderInfoCard**: Takes customer info and order details as direct props
- **OrderItemsTable**: Accepts an array of order item objects directly
- **OrderNotesCard**: Takes `notes` and `orderId` as direct props
- **StatusDropdown**: Remains with original props

### 2. Simplified Components

- Removed all dependencies on the `useOrderDetailContext` hook
- Simplified the component logic by removing unnecessary state management
- Focused each component on its core rendering responsibilities
- Removed editing functionality that was not being used

### 3. Performance Improvements

- Reduced re-render cascades by removing context dependency
- Each component now only re-renders when its specific props change
- Optimized the `OrderDetailsContainer` to use the `useOrderDetails` hook directly
- Applied memoization to prevent unnecessary renders

### 4. Component Interface Standardization

- Standardized the `CustomerDropdown` component to handle multiple interface patterns
- Made `CustomerDropdown` work with both old and new prop interfaces
- Applied consistent naming conventions and prop naming
- Used TypeScript interfaces for clear prop typing

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Components will re-render less frequently, and only when their specific data changes
2. **Maintainability**: Each component now has a clear contract through its props interface
3. **Debuggability**: Simplifies debugging since data flow is more explicit
4. **Reusability**: Components can be more easily reused in different contexts
5. **Bundle Size**: Reduces bundle size by removing context-related code

## Next Steps

- Apply similar refactoring to other complex components
- Consider adding proper integration tests for these components
- Monitor performance and make additional optimizations if needed
