   - [ ] Add proper loading and error states

2. **Items Management**
   - [ ] Follow same pattern as Orders
   - [ ] Create ItemsProvider context
   - [ ] Split components by responsibility
   - [ ] Improve performance with proper memoization
   - [ ] Implement streaming and suspense

3. **Customers Management**
   - [ ] Refactor CustomerForm into smaller components
   - [ ] Create CustomersProvider context
   - [ ] Implement proper state management
   - [ ] Fix table implementation

4. **Stock Movements**
   - [ ] Rename from "tx" to "movements" for clarity
   - [ ] Implement context-based state management
   - [ ] Optimize data loading strategies
   - [ ] Fix performance issues

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (2 weeks)

**Goals:**
- Implement performance improvements
- Add proper error boundaries
- Optimize bundle size

**Tasks:**

1. **Component Optimization**
   - [ ] Add proper memoization for expensive components
   - [ ] Fix unnecessary re-renders
   - [ ] Implement useMemo and useCallback correctly
   - [ ] Optimize large list rendering

2. **Server Component Migration**
   - [ ] Convert appropriate components to server components
   - [ ] Implement streaming responses
   - [ ] Add suspense boundaries
   - [ ] Implement proper loading UI

3. **Bundle Optimization**
   - [ ] Implement code splitting
   - [ ] Add dynamic imports for large components
   - [ ] Reduce client-side JavaScript
   - [ ] Analyze and optimize bundle size

4. **Data Fetching Optimization**
   - [ ] Implement parallel data fetching
   - [ ] Optimize caching strategies
   - [ ] Reduce waterfall requests
   - [ ] Implement data prefetching

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (Ongoing)

**Goals:**
- Add comprehensive testing
- Document new patterns
- Ensure consistency across codebase

**Tasks:**

1. **Testing Strategy**
   - [ ] Add unit tests for core components
   - [ ] Implement integration tests for features
   - [ ] Add end-to-end tests for critical flows
   - [ ] Set up CI/CD for automated testing

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Document patterns and standards
   - [ ] Create example implementations
   - [ ] Add inline documentation
   - [ ] Update README and contribution guidelines

3. **Code Quality**
   - [ ] Implement linting rules
   - [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
   - [ ] Set up code quality checks in CI
   - [ ] Add type checking to CI

## Implementation Approach

### Incremental Adoption

To minimize disruption, we'll follow an incremental approach:

1. **Parallel Implementation**:
   - Create new components alongside existing ones
   - Gradually switch over to new implementations
   - Mark old files as deprecated until fully migrated

2. **Feature-by-Feature Migration**:
   - Complete one feature before moving to the next
   - Start with highest-priority features (Orders)
   - Ensure full test coverage before moving on

3. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Maintain working application at all times
   - Regular deployments to test environments
   - Get feedback early and often

### Tracking Progress

We'll track migration progress using a combination of:

1. **GitHub Issues**:
   - Create issues for each task
   - Use labels for phases and priorities
   - Link PRs to issues

2. **Project Board**:
   - Track tasks across phases
   - Visualize progress
   - Identify blockers

3. **Documentation**:
   - Keep migration plan updated
   - Document completed tasks
   - Document patterns as they're implemented

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks

1. **Breaking Changes**:
   - Mitigate with comprehensive testing
   - Implement feature flags where appropriate
   - Gradual rollout of changes

2. **Developer Learning Curve**:
   - Provide documentation and examples
   - Hold knowledge sharing sessions
   - Pair programming for complex changes

3. **Regression Issues**:
   - Implement thorough testing
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Add proper error tracking

4. **Scope Creep**:
   - Stay focused on refactoring, not new features
   - Clear definition of "done" for each task
   - Regular progress reviews

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Weeks 1-2
- **Phase 2**: Weeks 3-5
- **Phase 3**: Weeks 6-9
- **Phase 4**: Weeks 10-11
- **Phase 5**: Ongoing

Total estimated time: 11 weeks for core refactoring, with ongoing improvements thereafter.

## Success Criteria

The refactoring will be considered successful when:

1. All features follow the new architecture patterns
2. Code is organized according to the new directory structure
3. Performance metrics show improvement
4. Developer experience is improved
5. Technical debt is reduced
6. Codebase is easier to maintain and extend
